This assignment uses React to make a simple calculator. We were given an option of having the calculations get made as the operations and numbers are entered (which makes the most sense to me for a calculator like this) or to have it follow some standard order of operations. As a math person, I hate the general public's fixation on questions about the order of operations through memes, but I selected this option since it was more challenging to implement - used some regex!
